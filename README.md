# About The Site
This is a website I am creating for my mother to have a nice front end for booking gigs that potential clients can use.

Some next steps for this project:
1. adding pictures
2. completing the bio
3. adding accurate contact information
4. cleaning up  colors
5. cleaning up formatting
6. making the website easy to reconfigure - adding and taking away portions for ease of use in the future; hopefully the website will be able to continually be adapted
